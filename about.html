          <h3>Hi, I'm Thy Dao.</h3>
          <p>My first name is pronounced like “tea,” which just so happens to be my favorite drink and is my inspiration for my personal logo!</p>
          <p>I am currently a senior studying <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/smad/" target="_blank" class="aboutlink">Media Arts and Design</a> at James Madison University. I am concentrated in Interactive Design and minoring in <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/coe/ltle/edmedia.shtml" target="_blank" class="aboutlink">Educational Media</a>.  I plan to graduate in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Media Arts and Design.</p>
          <p>My love for stories has always been a part of my life, from reading way past my bedtime to writing short stories to give my emotions a name and narrative. I am enthusiastic about using technology  to express the stories and ideas I am trying to tell, as well as to connect with people and unravel their needs. I have channeled my passions into UX, UI, web, and graphic design.</p>
          <p>I am a problem-solver who never shrinks from a challenge, and I am an attentive and determined designer with a user-centered approach. My aim is to create elegant, yet meaningful, design solutions for a diverse audience.</p>
          <p>Please feel free to contact me with any questions, whether it's about me or my work, and learn more about me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thydao/" target="_blank" class="aboutlink">LinkedIn</a>!</p>
          <p>I would also like to mention that I've worked on many <em>many</em> projects throughout my years as a designer and while most have had a happy ending, some are simply odd pieces that I could have done better on or are pieces of good work with no backbone (or really any framework whatsoever). If you're interested, check out my miscellaneous collection of old/unorganized work on my <a href="https://www.behance.net/thydao" target="_blank" class="aboutlink">Behance</a>.</p>

          <h3>About my process,</h3>
          <p>Design thinking is a tool I've learned about in my major courses (User Interaction Design and Foundations of User Experience Design) that I will continue to use throughout my career as a designer. It is essentially made up of the steps in the provided graphic, which is from the Nielson Norman Group.</p>
          <p>Design thinking is a non-linear process that is user focused and aims to generate creative solutions to social or design problems. It's a great tool to use to address issues at a strategic level, and by incorporating this process into my work, it has helped me process and visualize the complex variables that arise within my projects and give me the appropriate framework to help explain my ideas and decisions to others.</p>
