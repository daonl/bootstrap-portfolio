              <h3>The Challenge</h3>
              <p>Snapchat is a social media messaging app that, as of 2020, has 238 million daily active users worldwide. One of the features it's best known for is that pictures and messages exchanged on the app are usually only available for a short time before they become inaccessible to their recipients.</p>
              <p>I've been a somewhat dedicated user of Snapchat since 2013. Recently, I've been using Snapchat daily to stay in touch with friends during the pandemic, primarily using its chat feature to send and receive images, videos, and text. Although the app has a variety of engaging features and has had many different changes and innovations emerge over the years, it is far from perfect. More than once, I've forgotten to save important text chat messages before they're deleted in 24 hours and struggled to find group chats or conversations I've had previously. <strong>I wanted to facilitate a more engaging and seamless experience when it comes to staying connected through the chat feature.</strong></p>

              <h3>The Process</h3>
              <img src="images/designthinkingthy.png" alt="Design thinking process from empathy to iteration." class="img-fluid">
              <p>For this redesign project, I utilized the Design Thinking process. Design thinking is a non-linear process that is user focused and aims to generate creative solutions to social or design problems. It's a great tool to use to address issues at a strategic level, and by incorporating this process into my work, it has helped me process and visualize the complex variables that arise within my projects.</p>

              <h3>Empathize</h3>

              <h4>App Analysis</h4>
              <p>I began by mapping out the user flow of Snapchat's text chat feature to better understand its strengths and weaknesses. This first user flow shows us how users start a new chat. Open images in a new tab to view them at a larger scale.</p>

              <a href="#snapchatuserflow1Modal" role="button" data-toggle="modal"><img src="images/snapchatuserflow1.png" alt="User flow of Snapchat text chat feature." class="img-fluid"></a>

              <a href="#snapchatuserflow2Modal" role="button" data-toggle="modal"><img src="images/snapchatuserflow2.png" alt="User flow of Snapchat text chat feature." class="img-fluid"></a>

              <p></p>

              <p>The second following user flow continues from the last one and demonstrates how users can save messages within the chat.</p>

              <a href="#snapchatuserflow3Modal" role="button" data-toggle="modal"><img src="images/snapchatuserflow3.png" alt="User flow of Snapchat text chat feature." class="img-fluid"></a>

              <a href="#snapchatuserflow4Modal" role="button" data-toggle="modal"><img src="images/snapchatuserflow4.png" alt="User flow of Snapchat text chat feature." class="img-fluid"></a>

              <a href="#snapchatuserflow5Modal" role="button" data-toggle="modal"><img src="images/snapchatuserflow5.png" alt="User flow of Snapchat text chat feature." class="img-fluid"></a>

              <p></p>

              <p>Messages can also be unsaved the same way&#58; the user can press and hold on the saved message and press "Unsave in Chat" to unsave the message.</p>

              <h4>User Research</h4>
              <p>Before I began my redesign project, I conducted a Google Forms survey with 31 participants to get a better understanding of who I'm designing for. What does a typical Snapchat user look like? What are their reasons for using Snapchat? What feature is most important to them? My participants were all students of varying ages, years, and majors at James Madison University who use Snapchat or had used Snapchat before.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>87.1&percnt; of them used Snapchat daily.</li>

                <img src="images/dailyusage.png" alt="Pie chart demonstrating how often participatns use Snapchat." class="img-fluid" id="redesign-intro-pic">

                <li>71&percnt; of them reported that sending and receiving Snaps is the most important feature to them.</li>

                <img src="images/importantfeature.png" alt="Pie chart demonstrating features that were most important to participants." class="img-fluid" id="redesign-intro-pic">

                <li>74.2&percnt; of them reported that they have had difficulty locating specific chat messages.</li>

                <img src="images/difficultychat.png" alt="Pie chart demonstrating how many participants had difficulty locating chat messages." class="img-fluid" id="redesign-intro-pic">

              </ul>
              <p>They were asked to elaborate in the next survey question, which was a text entry box, and many users complained that they would forget to save previous conversations, couldn't easily find older saved messages, or simply disliked that they had to save chats or else they got deleted. One user said, &#34;I often save funny memes in our conversations using the Save in Chat feature, but I rarely ever look back at them, especially when it gets pushed down into my older conversations.&#34;</p>

              <h3>Define the Problem</h3>

              <h4>Paint Point &#35;1&#58; Users have difficulty remembering to save previous conversations.</h4>
              <p>blah blah blah.</p>

              <h4>Paint Point &#35;2&#58; Users have difficulty remembering to save previous conversations.</h4>
              <p>blah blah blah.</p>

              <h4>Paint Point &#35;3&#58; Users have difficulty remembering to save previous conversations.</h4>
              <p>blah blah blah.</p>
